# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization
This project aims to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard for visualizing PhonePe Pulse data. The solution involves data extraction from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository, data transformation using Python and Pandas, database insertion into MySQL, dashboard creation using Streamlit and Plotly, data retrieval for dynamic updates, and deployment of the solution.

Steps to Implement the Solution
## 1. Data Extraction
Clone the GitHub repository containing PhonePe Pulse data using scripting. This can be achieved using Git commands in a shell script or using GitPython library in Python.

## 2. Data Transformation
Use Python along with Pandas library to manipulate and pre-process the data. Perform tasks such as cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a suitable format for analysis and visualization.

## 3. Database Insertion
Connect to a MySQL database using the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python. Insert the transformed data into the database using SQL commands. Ensure proper schema design and data integrity.

## 4. Dashboard Creation
Utilize Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Use Plotly's built-in geo map functions to display the data on a map. Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

## 5. Data Retrieval
Connect to the MySQL database using the "mysql-connector-python" library to fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically based on user inputs or scheduled updates.

## 6. Deployment
Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Test the solution thoroughly to identify and fix any issues. Deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users. Consider using Streamlit.

## Usage
1. Run the data extraction script to fetch data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.
2. Run the data transformation script to preprocess the data.
3. Run the database insertion script to insert the transformed data into MySQL.
4. Run the dashboard script to create and deploy the dashboard.
5. Users can access the deployed dashboard and interact with it to visualize PhonePe Pulse data.
